# Atmospheric Carbon Data on The Permaweb
Archives the daily CO2 ppm measurement from NOAA ESRL to the Arweave network

## About This Project
The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/) (NOAA ESRL) measures and publishes global average atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. These measurements are important for ongoing climate science and so this project aims to archive NOAA ESRL's measurements to ensure their being available for scientists in the future.


## CO2 PPM
Measuing atmospheric carbon levels is important because greenhouse gases such as CO2 trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the global heating.

Climate.gov has a [great resource](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) on CO2 ppm measurements and their levels today. In their words:

> The last time the atmospheric CO2 amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2°–3°C (3.6°–5.4°F) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.
> Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years.

## Developer Note
To run this locally, you will need an `arweave-file.json` file in the project directory with an Arweave wallet keyfile. To obtain an Arweave wallet keyfile, [follow this guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet).
